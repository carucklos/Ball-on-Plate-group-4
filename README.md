## **V.** *Conclusion*
  After performing the design project, we not only learned the basics of balancing a ball on the  plate, but we learned how to build the    systems from the ground up using controlled system algorithms we obtained throughout the semester.  The ball and the plate project      began with the free body diagram shown in figure1. After we understand the logic of how the mechanical system works, we can then        convert that into mathematical equations that can be implemented into softwares like matlab and coppelia. Matlab simplified our work    by performing the calculations for us so we did not have to solve it by ourselves which would increase our chances of error. After      completing the matlab portion of the project we can then implement it with coppelia and run the simulation.
